# docker-compose.override.yml.example
#
# This file demonstrates how to mount additional folders into your devcontainer.
# Docker Compose automatically merges docker-compose.override.yml with docker-compose.yml.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this file: cp docker-compose.override.yml.example docker-compose.override.yml
#   2. Uncomment and modify the mounts below
#   3. Rebuild your devcontainer
#
# Note: docker-compose.override.yml is gitignored, so your local mounts won't be committed.
