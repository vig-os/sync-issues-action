# [PR 30](https://github.com/vig-os/sync-issues-action/pull/30) chore(ci): clarify weekly CodeQL scheduled scan purpose

## Summary
- Clarifies the weekly CodeQL schedule comment in `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`
- Makes explicit that the scheduled run re-scans with updated CodeQL rules/engines even when repository code has not changed
- Removes ambiguity noted in PR #22 review discussion

## Test plan
- [x] Confirm only workflow comments changed (no runtime workflow logic changes)
- [x] Validate YAML remains syntactically valid
- [x] Verify wording addresses reviewer question about schedule purpose

Refs: #29
