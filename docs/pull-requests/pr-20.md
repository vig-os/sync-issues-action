# [PR 20](https://github.com/vig-os/sync-issues-action/pull/20) fix(ci): use app token for PR creation in prepare-release

## Summary

- The "Create draft PR to main" step in `prepare-release.yml` was using `github.token` (the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`), which lacks permission to create pull requests when the repo setting is disabled. Switched to the GitHub App token (`steps.app-token.outputs.token`) already generated earlier in the same job.

## Test plan

- [ ] Re-run the Prepare Release workflow and confirm the draft PR is created successfully
