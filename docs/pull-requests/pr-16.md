# [PR 16](https://github.com/vig-os/sync-issues-action/pull/16) fix: suppress sub-issues GraphQL warnings and fix field name

## Summary

- Fix root cause: GraphQL query used `parentIssue` (doesn't exist) instead of `parent` (correct field name). Remove unnecessary `GraphQL-Features: sub_issues` preview header.
- Add `sync-sub-issues` action input (default `true`) so users can disable sub-issue fetching on environments where the fields are unavailable (e.g. older GHES).
- Graceful schema error handling: emit `core.info()` instead of `core.warning()` when the sub-issues fields don't exist, and continue without relationships.
- Integration test: verify parent/children frontmatter on issues 13 and 15 using this repo's own data.

## Test plan

- [x] Unit tests pass (93/93)
- [ ] Integration test in CI validates `issue-15.md` has `parent: 13` and `issue-13.md` lists `15` as a child
