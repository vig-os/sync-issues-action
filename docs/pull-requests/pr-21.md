# [PR 21](https://github.com/vig-os/sync-issues-action/pull/21) fix(ci): use dedicated release app for release lifecycle workflows

## Summary

- Switch `prepare-release.yml`, `release.yml`, and `post-release.yml` from `APP_SYNC_ISSUES_*` secrets to `RELEASE_APP_*` secrets, pointing to a dedicated GitHub App with the required permissions (`contents:write`, `pull-requests:write`, `issues:write`).
- The previous fix (#20, commit ffe9e9b) misdiagnosed the root cause: it switched the PR creation step to `github.token`, but that token also cannot create PRs when the repo setting "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" is disabled. The correct fix is to use an App token from an App that has `pull-requests:write` permission.

Fixes #18

## Test plan

- [x] Verify `RELEASE_APP_ID` and `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` secrets are configured
- [ ] Re-run the Prepare Release workflow and confirm the draft PR is created successfully
