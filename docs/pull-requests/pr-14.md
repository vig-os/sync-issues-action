# [PR 14](https://github.com/vig-os/sync-issues-action/pull/14) ci: develop and validate CI/CD workflows

## Description

Add the full CI/CD pipeline for the project: a CI workflow for pull request checks, a release workflow for versioned publishing, security scanning, and supporting composite actions.

## Type of Change

- [ ] `feat` -- New feature
- [ ] `fix` -- Bug fix
- [ ] `docs` -- Documentation only
- [ ] `chore` -- Maintenance task (deps, config, etc.)
- [ ] `refactor` -- Code restructuring (no behavior change)
- [ ] `test` -- Adding or updating tests
- [x] `ci` -- CI/CD pipeline changes
- [x] `build` -- Build system or dependency changes
- [ ] `revert` -- Reverts a previous commit
- [ ] `style` -- Code style (formatting, whitespace)

### Modifiers

- [ ] Breaking change (`!`) -- This change breaks backward compatibility

## Changes Made

- Add CI workflow with lint, build, test, dependency-review, and summary gate jobs
- Add release workflow with validate → finalize → test → release → rollback stages and dry-run support
- Add CodeQL static analysis and OpenSSF Scorecard security workflows
- Add `setup-env` composite action for consistent Node.js + npm setup across workflows
- Add `build-dist` composite action for ncc bundling and dist/ diff verification
- Add Dependabot configuration for weekly Actions and npm dependency updates
- Add `.nvmrc` pinning Node.js 20 as the single source of truth across CI and devcontainer
- Rebuild dist bundle for the force-update input that was committed without a dist rebuild (#10)

## Changelog Entry

### Added

- **CI/CD pipeline** ([#13](https://github.com/vig-os/sync-issues-action/issues/13))
  - CI workflow running lint, test, dependency-review, and summary gate jobs on PRs to `dev`, `release/**`, and `main`
  - Release workflow with dry-run support, CHANGELOG date finalization, and automatic rollback with failure issue on error
  - CodeQL static analysis on PRs and pushes, and OpenSSF Scorecard supply-chain security analysis uploading SARIF to the Security tab
  - `setup-env` composite action for consistent Node.js installation and npm dependency caching across workflows
  - `build-dist` composite action for ncc bundling and dist diff verification to prevent stale compiled output
  - Dependabot configuration for automated weekly updates of GitHub Actions (sha-pinned) and npm packages targeting `dev`
  - `.nvmrc` pinning Node.js 20 as the single source of truth for the runtime version
  - `install-uv` input on `setup-env` to optionally install `uv` on GitHub-hosted runners for `pre-commit`

## Testing

- [ ] Tests pass locally (`npm test`)
- [x] Manual testing performed (describe below)

### Manual Testing Details

Workflows validated via pre-commit YAML linting and action-pin checks. Full end-to-end testing requires a push to the remote and observing GitHub Actions runs.

## Checklist

- [x] My code follows the project's style guidelines
- [x] I have performed a self-review of my code
- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [x] I have updated the documentation accordingly
- [x] I have updated `CHANGELOG.md` in the `[Unreleased]` section (and pasted the entry above)
- [x] My changes generate no new warnings or errors
- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works
- [x] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes
- [x] Any dependent changes have been merged and published

## Additional Notes

The `build-dist` action enforces that `dist/` is always committed in sync with source. Going forward, any PR with stale dist will fail the CI `build` job. The `.nvmrc` file ensures local devcontainer and CI always use the same Node.js major version — bumping Node requires only a single-line change.
