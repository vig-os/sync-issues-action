# [PR 32](https://github.com/vig-os/sync-issues-action/pull/32) fix: allow reusable workflow permissions in release integration test

## Description
Fix release workflow validation failure in dry-run mode by allowing the reusable integration test workflow to request required read scopes.

## Type of Change
- [x] `fix` -- Bug fix
- [ ] `ci` -- CI/CD pipeline changes

### Modifiers
- [ ] Breaking change (`!`) -- This change breaks backward compatibility

## Changes Made
- Added job-level permissions to `integration-test` in `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Granted only minimum required scopes: `contents: read`, `issues: read`, `pull-requests: read`

## Changelog Entry
No changelog needed (workflow permission fix only).

## Testing
- [ ] Tests pass locally (`npm test`)
- [x] Manual testing performed (describe below)

### Manual Testing Details
- Verified workflow schema error cause against reusable workflow requested permissions.
- Confirmed caller now explicitly allows required read scopes.
