# [PR 35](https://github.com/vig-os/sync-issues-action/pull/35) chore: merge release/0.2.0 back into dev to retrigger prepare release

## Summary
- Merge `release/0.2.0` back into `dev` to realign branches after fixing issue #34 (immutable release errors).
- Retrigger the `prepare release` workflow from a clean state after the permissions/workflow fix.
- Preserve release workflow continuity without introducing new feature changes.

## Test plan
- [ ] Confirm PR merges cleanly into `dev`.
- [ ] Verify `prepare release` workflow triggers after merge.
- [ ] Verify workflow run completes without immutable release errors (issue #34).

Refs: #34
