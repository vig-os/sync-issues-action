# [Issue 2]: [[FEATURE] Fetch images and other attachments from issues and PRs](https://github.com/vig-os/sync-issues-action/issues/2)

### Description

The action should fetch images and other attachments from issues and PRs, store them in some folder and include them in the MD files.

### Problem Statement

Conversations and descriptions might be incomplete without the context provided by attachments.

### Proposed Solution

Fetch attachments and save them locally, making them available for MD rendering.

### Alternatives Considered

HTML code pointing to the online attachment, but this introduces online requirement and dependency to GitHub

### Additional Context

### Impact
