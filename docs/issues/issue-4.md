# [Issue 4]: [[BUG] Header levels in comments do not follow hierarchy](https://github.com/vig-os/sync-issues-action/issues/4)

### Description

Header levels in comments should respect hierarchy after being pulled into the issue or PR document.

### Steps to Reproduce

From [here](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/68#issuecomment-3919321616), see this comment:

```
## Idea: Use GitHub issue bodies for implementation plan tracking instead of `docs/plans/` files

The current `/plan` command writes plans to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>-plan.md` and `/execute-plan` reads from there. An alternative approach: write and track the implementation plan directly in the **GitHub issue body** (using task lists / checkboxes), and have the agent update task status there as work progresses.

### How it would work

- `/plan` reads the issue, breaks it into tasks, then **appends or replaces a "## Implementation Plan" section** in the issue body (via `gh issue edit --body`).
```



### Expected Behavior

It should become:
