# Post-Release — Sync dev with main after merge
#
# Triggered automatically when a PR is merged into main.
# Keeps the dev branch in sync by merging main back into dev.
#
# After a release merge (release/X.Y.Z -> main):
#   - Merges main into dev
#   - Resets CHANGELOG Unreleased section for next cycle
#
# After any other merge to main (e.g., hotfix):
#   - Merges main into dev
#   - CHANGELOG reset is skipped (only release branches need it)
#
# NOTE: GitHub Actions does not support a "merged" filter on pull_request
# triggers. This fires on every closed PR targeting main; the job-level `if`
# condition below correctly skips runs where the PR was closed without merging.
